After death of Shockwave Flash Player in January of 2021, this popular game became impossible to play. We are here to give a new engine to this old game from 2004.

The game is currently in development, for updates, visit my Instagram profile: https://instagram.com/mvlabs.dev.

It is made purely in Unity 3D and coded in C#.
**It will be availible on Google Play Store**

Key differences between this version and the original will be:

**Hardcore Mode - Get through the second tunnel more times before opening the rest of the map to get to the finish.**

**Leaderboards - Keep stats of Picked Collectables, Best Time. You would be able to compete against other players.**

The things listed above are only planned and will be added in upcoming updates.
